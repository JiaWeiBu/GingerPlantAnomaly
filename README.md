## Introduction
GingerPlantAnomaly is a project designed to detect anomalies in ginger plants using unsupervised learning techniques. It leverages state-of-the-art anomaly detection models to identify defects in plant images.

## Features
- Supports multiple anomaly detection models (e.g., PaDiM, PatchCore, etc.).
- Compatible with the MVTec dataset.
- Provides training, testing, and evaluation pipelines.
- Includes Discord bot integration for logging and notifications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
